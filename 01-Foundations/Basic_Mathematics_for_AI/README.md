# Basic Mathematics for AI

Understanding the mathematical foundations is crucial for grasping the concepts and algorithms used in AI. This submodule covers the essential areas of linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics that form the backbone of AI and machine learning.

## 1. [Linear Algebra](Linear_Algebra.md)

### Vectors and Matrices

- **Vectors**: An ordered list of numbers. Used to represent data points, features, and weights in AI models.
- **Matrices**: A rectangular array of numbers. Used to represent datasets, transformations, and neural network parameters.

### Matrix Operations

- **Addition**: Element-wise addition of two matrices of the same dimension.
- **Multiplication**: Includes both element-wise multiplication and matrix multiplication.
- **Transpose**: Flipping a matrix over its diagonal.
- **Inverse**: A matrix that, when multiplied by the original matrix, yields the identity matrix.

### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

- **Eigenvalues**: Scalars that indicate the factor by which the eigenvector is scaled during the linear transformation.
- **Eigenvectors**: Non-zero vectors that change only in scale when a linear transformation is applied.

## 2. [Calculus](Calculus.md)

### Derivatives and Integrals

- **Derivatives**: Measure the rate of change of a function with respect to its variables. Essential for optimization in machine learning.
- **Integrals**: Represent the accumulation of quantities and are used in areas like probability.

### Gradient Descent

- **Gradient Descent**: An iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function in machine learning models by updating the model parameters in the direction of the steepest descent.

### Partial Derivatives

- **Partial Derivatives**: Derivatives of functions with multiple variables. Used to compute gradients in multivariable optimization problems.

## 3. [Probability and Statistics](Probability_and_Statistics.md)

### Random Variables and Distributions

- **Random Variables**: Variables that take on different values based on the outcome of a random event.
- **Probability Distributions**: Describe how probabilities are distributed over the values of the random variable (e.g., Normal distribution, Binomial distribution).

### Bayes' Theorem

- **Bayes' Theorem**: Provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. Fundamental in Bayesian inference.

### Statistical Inference

- **Statistical Inference**: Techniques for drawing conclusions about a population based on sample data. Includes hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.

## Applications in AI

### Linear Algebra in AI

- **Data Representation**: Vectors and matrices are used to represent datasets and perform operations on them.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduce the number of features while retaining important information.
- **Neural Networks**: Matrices are used to represent the weights and biases in neural networks.

### Calculus in AI

- **Optimization**: Gradient descent and its variants (e.g., Stochastic Gradient Descent) are used to minimize the loss function during model training.
- **Backpropagation**: An algorithm in neural networks that uses calculus to compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight.

### Probability and Statistics in AI

- **Modeling Uncertainty**: Probabilistic models (e.g., Bayesian Networks) represent uncertainty and make predictions based on incomplete data.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Techniques to evaluate the significance of results and ensure they are not due to random chance.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Many algorithms, like Naive Bayes and Hidden Markov Models, are based on probabilistic principles.
